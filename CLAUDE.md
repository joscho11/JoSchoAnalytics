# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

BettingEdge is an NFL Against-the-Spread (ATS) prediction system combining:
- A pre-trained XGBoost ML model for predicting game margins
- A Claude-powered LLM agent (via LlamaIndex) for qualitative game reasoning
- A Streamlit dashboard for visualization (deployed at joschobetting.streamlit.app)
- GitHub Actions for weekly automated predictions (Mon/Thu/Sun)

## Common Commands

**Run the dashboard locally:**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Runs on port 8501. Requires `betting/predictions_tracker.csv` and any cached `betting/agent_analysis_2025_week*.json` files.

**Run the prediction pipeline:**
```bash
papermill betting/predict_betting.ipynb /tmp/out.ipynb -p MODE monday    # Update results + new predictions
papermill betting/predict_betting.ipynb /tmp/out.ipynb -p MODE thursday  # Refresh with injury data
papermill betting/predict_betting.ipynb /tmp/out.ipynb -p MODE sunday    # Final predictions
```

**Run fantasy projections:**
```bash
papermill fantasy/predict_fantasy.ipynb /tmp/out.ipynb                                      # auto-detect week
papermill fantasy/predict_fantasy.ipynb /tmp/out.ipynb -p TARGET_SEASON 2025 -p TARGET_WEEK 14
```

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Environment variables** (from `.env`): `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID`

## Architecture

### Core Files
- **`betting/predict_betting.ipynb`** — The prediction pipeline. Pulls live NFL data via `nflreadpy`, engineers features, loads `betting/betting_model.pkl`, computes predicted margin vs. Vegas spread to find edges, and commits results to `betting/predictions_tracker.csv`. Run via papermill; `MODE` is the papermill parameter.
- **`app.py`** — Streamlit dashboard with 3 tabs: Weekly Predictions, Season Performance, Help & Guide. Reads `betting/predictions_tracker.csv` and cached `betting/agent_analysis_2025_week{n}.json` files for LLM agent reasoning overlays.
- **`betting/betting_model.pkl`** — Pre-trained XGBoost `sklearn` pipeline (includes `preprocessor` step with OneHotEncoder + StandardScaler). Not retrained in `predict_betting.ipynb`.
- **`betting/predictions_tracker.csv`** — Master log of all predictions and outcomes. Auto-committed by GitHub Actions.

### Feature Groups (betting/predict_betting.ipynb — helpers cell)
1. Schedule context: temperature, wind, surface, playoff flag, final-week flag
2. Rolling PBP stats: EPA, yards/play (5-game windows)
3. Strength of schedule: opponent win% (rolling 3-game and season-long)
4. All-Pro roster quality: weighted 3-year lookback, offense/defense split
5. Rolling performance: win%, points scored/allowed (5-game windows)

### LLM Agent
Developed in `betting/sports_betting_agent.ipynb`. Uses LlamaIndex `ReActAgent` with 5 tools (predictions lookup, injury reports, line movement, matchup history, confidence analysis). Output is cached per week as `betting/agent_analysis_2025_week{n}.json` and displayed in the dashboard as confidence overlays (HIGH/MEDIUM/SKIP).

### Data
- `betting/nfl_allpro_1997_2025.csv` — All-Pro roster data; updated manually each January
- `fantasy/features_dataset.csv` — Engineered feature dataset (built by `fantasy/data_pipeline.ipynb`)
- Live schedule, PBP, and stats pulled from `nflreadpy` at prediction time

### Automation
`.github/workflows/weekly_predictions.yml` runs `betting/predict_betting.ipynb` via papermill on three cron schedules (Mon 9am ET, Thu 9pm ET, Sun 7am ET) and commits the updated tracker. Supports manual dispatch with mode selection.

## Key Constraints
- The XGBoost model pipeline expects a `preprocessor` named step — don't change the pkl structure without retraining.
- `betting/nfl_allpro_1997_2025.csv` must be updated manually each January for the new season.
- Agent analysis JSON files are cached by week; regenerating them requires re-running the agent notebook and costs API calls.
- The dashboard reads the tracker CSV directly — column names and structure in `betting/predictions_tracker.csv` must stay consistent with `app.py` expectations.

## Fantasy Model (`fantasy/`)

A half-PPR fantasy football points prediction system for NFL skill position players (QB, RB, WR, TE). Standalone ML pipeline with three notebooks run in order:

| Notebook | Input | Output | Purpose |
|----------|-------|--------|---------|
| `data_pipeline.ipynb` | nflreadpy (live) | `raw_dataset.csv` | Pulls and joins player stats, schedules, injury reports, depth charts, team metrics |
| `features.ipynb` | `raw_dataset.csv` | `features_dataset.csv` | Engineers rolling windows, trends, weather, injury/availability features |
| `model.ipynb` | `features_dataset.csv` | `models/*.pkl` | Trains and evaluates per-position XGBoost models |

**Datasets:**
- `raw_dataset.csv` — 34,907 rows × 84 columns (output of `data_pipeline.ipynb`)
- `features_dataset.csv` — 30,213 rows × 88 columns (output of `features.ipynb`; drops last week of each season + week-1 players with no rolling history)

Target: `target_half_ppr` (half-PPR points in week W+1).

**Model:** One XGBoost regressor per position (QB, RB, WR, TE). Train on 2020–2024, holdout 2025. Saved to `models/{position}_model.pkl` as `{'model': XGBRegressor, 'feature_cols': list}`.

**2025 holdout results** (vs 3-week rolling average baseline):

| Position | Train rows | Test rows | MAE | RMSE | Baseline MAE |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----|------|--------------|
| QB | 2,723 | 571 | 7.11 | 8.77 | 7.49 |
| RB | 6,536 | 1,397 | 4.49 | 6.57 | 4.59 |
| WR | 10,464 | 2,215 | 3.92 | 5.39 | 4.06 |
| TE | 5,162 | 1,145 | 3.26 | 4.74 | 3.48 |

### data_pipeline.ipynb — Feature Groups

The notebook is structured in 4 parts + a master rebuild cell. Run cells top-to-bottom, or run the **Master Rebuild** cell (Part 3 → Part 4 boundary) to reconstruct `df` cleanly before running Part 4 steps.

**Part 1 — Raw Data Loading**
- `nfl.load_player_stats(SEASONS)` → filtered to REG, QB/RB/WR/TE
- `nfl.load_ff_opportunity(SEASONS)` → expected points (ffo_expected_pts, ffo_pts_diff)
- `nfl.load_schedules(SEASONS)` → Vegas lines, weather, home/away, rest days

**Part 2 — Base DataFrame Assembly**
- Merges player stats + FFO + Vegas/weather into base `df`
- Key columns: `spread_line`, `total_line`, `implied_team_total`, `wind`, `temp`, `is_home`

**Part 3 — Injury, Depth Chart & Surface Features**
- Player's own injury status: `injury_status_score`, `practice_status_score`
- Teammate availability: `starter_qb/rb/wr/te_availability`
- Opponent defensive starters: `opp_cb1/de1/lb1_availability` etc.
- Offensive line starters: `starter_tackle/guard/center_availability`
- Depth chart position: `depth_chart_position` (1 = starter)
- Surface: `is_turf` (binary)

**Part 4 — New Feature Groups** (added 2026-05-12)

| Step | Columns | Source | Notes |
|------|---------|--------|-------|
| Step 1 — Coach Win % | `coach_win_pct`, `opp_coach_win_pct` | `nfl.load_schedules(1999–2025)` | ~9.9% null for new coaches (<10 career games) — impute in features.ipynb |
| Step 2 — Offensive Metrics | `off_epa_roll4`, `off_yards_per_play_roll4`, `off_pass_rate_roll4`, `off_red_zone_rate_roll4` | `nfl.load_pbp(SEASONS)` | Rolling 4-game window, shift(1) to avoid leakage; ~1% null (week 1) |
| Step 3 — Defensive Metrics | `def_epa_allowed_roll4`, `def_yards_allowed_roll4`, `def_pass_rate_faced_roll4`, `def_red_zone_allowed_roll4` | same PBP | Joined on `opponent_team`; same null pattern as Step 2 |
| Step 4 — All-Pro Counts | `team_allpro_weighted`, `team_offense_allpro`, `team_defense_allpro`, `opp_allpro_weighted`, `opp_offense_allpro`, `opp_defense_allpro` | `betting/nfl_allpro_1997_2025.csv` | Weighted 3-year lookback (4/2/1); 0 nulls |

### Editing data_pipeline.ipynb
The notebook file exceeds the Read tool's token limit. **Always edit it via `python << 'PYEOF'` here-doc with `json.load/dump`** — do not use the NotebookEdit or Read tools. Use forward-slash paths (not `r"C:\..."`) inside here-docs to avoid unicode escape errors on Windows.

### features.ipynb — TODO
- Impute `coach_win_pct` / `opp_coach_win_pct` nulls (median fill or add `is_new_coach` binary flag)
- Rolling week-1 nulls for off/def metrics will naturally fill with rolling logic already in features.ipynb

**Key constraints:**
- Never shuffle train/test split across seasons — always split on season boundaries to avoid leakage.
- Drop identity columns (`player_id`, `player_display_name`, `position`, `team`, `opponent_team`, `season`, `week`) before fitting.
- Always use `features_dataset.csv` as model input, not `raw_dataset.csv` (raw contains current-week stats that leak the target).
- `betting/nfl_allpro_1997_2025.csv` must be updated each January before re-running `data_pipeline.ipynb`.
- All rolling features in `data_pipeline.ipynb` use `shift(1).rolling(n, min_periods=1)` — never `shift(fill_value=0)` which leaks across group boundaries.
